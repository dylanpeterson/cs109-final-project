### Overview
In this project, we used multiple statistical models to make predictions about if a rice strain matures faster based on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypic features. SNPs were obtained from the AWS 3k Rice Genome project, hosted on s3, which contained multiple data files. One of which was a set of 990,009 SNPs for the 3k strains that were compared against a reference genome. This data was used in combination with phenotypic data from the International Rice Genebank Collection Information System.
